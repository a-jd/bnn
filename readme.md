# BNN: Bubble Neural Network

This repository features the development of a neural network model to measure gas-liquid flowrate for high-resolution experimental data.
The paper describing the outcome from the BNN project is available at [arXiv:2003.08182 [physics.flu-dyn]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08182).
